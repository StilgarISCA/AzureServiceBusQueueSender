## Azure Service Bus Queue Sender
This Visual Studio solution contains a console application that can send messages to a Microsoft Azure Service Bus Queue.

This probably isn't the greatest code becuase I wrote it as a test application just to experiment with sending queue messages through Service Bus for the first time.
